This plugin allows you to import your Awin Datafeed and sell the products from any widget area.

== Description ==
If you are an Awin publisher who doesn't have the resources, time or technical know-how to import our datafeeds in to your site then this is the tool for you. All you need is to import the plugin from the setting page and you will have nice widgets and shortcodes ready for your visitors. This is the easy way to promote affiliate products through great looking widgets.

= What is Datafeed ? =
Our wiki has a whole host of information regarding our datafeeds http://wiki.awin.com/index.php/Downloading_A_Feed

You will need to be an Awin publisher to download our datafeeds. This is done through our create-a-feed tool which allows you to create a download based on three criteria Category, Advertiser and Brand.

<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
Category - Advertisers map the categories in their feeds to our category tree. The category tree can be expanded and you can drill down to the lower levels of our tree. Besides each category you will see the count of products available to download.
</li>
<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
Advertiser - When you select Advertiser you can chose from a selection of your joined advertisers (as well as open advertisers).
</li>
<li style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
Brand - Filtering by Brand allows you to search for a particular brand and only download products that have that brand associated with them.
</li>

Once you have defined the products the next stage is to determine how you would like to download the datafeed. Certain fields are mandatory and the remainder can be toggled to select. Please note that not all fields may be in use by the advertiser.

= How do I use it? =
When you have chosen the columns you are downloading and are happy with the order then you can choose your file format, delimiter and compression type. There is also the option to include adult content, if unchecked then certain adult categories will be removed from the feed. To access the feed you can download it directly from the interface or you can use the generated URL to access that feed in that specified structure at any time. You can create as many of these URLs as you like.

For this plugin you need to download the feed directly as a csv format and then import it.

= What pre-requisites are there for using this service? =
You have to be registered as a publisher on the Awin platform. Sign up is a simple process which you can do here - https://ui.awin.com/affiliate-signup/account-details

All sign ups are vetted by our compliance team and as such, after signup, there is a small delay before you are accepted as an Awin publisher.
